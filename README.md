# The Conference Agenda

You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.

Here are some important details about this conference:
*	The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.
*	Each session contains multiple talks.
*	Morning sessions begin at 9 am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.
*	Afternoon sessions begin at 1 pm and must finish by 5 pm for snacks.
*	No talk title has numbers in it.
*	All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).
*	Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.

Note that depending on how you choose to complete this problem, your solution may give a different ordering or combination of talks into tracks. This is acceptable; you donâ€™t need to exactly duplicate the sample output given here.

#### Input Format:

The first line will contain an integer N. N lines follow each will contain a string.

#### Output Format:

For each query output the solution to the problem. Refer to the sample output for further clarification.

#### Constraints:

1 <= N <= 20
Every string will contain a text initially (which may contain space) followed by time of completion in minutes at the end. Refer to sample input for further clarification.
